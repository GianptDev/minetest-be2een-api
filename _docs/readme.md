Here all the stuff to build the wiki, is required to install python (with pip) and sphinx.

Install sphinx:

	python -m pip install sphinx

Install theme:

	pip install sphinx-rtd-theme

Currently no wiki :( I need to find a way to automatize it, there are too many functions.

This folder is unused but is kept if one day I'll decide to finalize the wiki.
